        p.show1();  // Output: Static method in parent1
        // p.show(); //  Won't compile if uncommented because the reference type (staticMethodInInheritace) doesnâ€™t know about show()
        
        childClass c = new childClass();  //here childclass know about show1() and show() because it inherits from staticMethodInInheritace(parent)
        c.show1();  // Output: Static method in parent1

//Even though p refers to a Child object, the type of the reference is Parent. 
//And static methods are resolved at compile time, not at runtime like instance methods. 
//So Java looks at the reference type, not the object type.

//This is called method hiding, not overriding
